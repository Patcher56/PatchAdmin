<h1>PatchProtect</h1>

PatchProtect is a fast, simple and stable prop protection for Garry's Mod 13.

<h2>Why we recommend, using PatchProtect?</h2>

<h3>Lagfree and highest performance:</h3>
We try to keep the CPU-Usage as low as possible to save resources for the server and keep it lagfree from PatchProtect.

<h3>AntiSpam</h3>
We offer a nice working <b>AntiSpam-Function</b>, so that people are not able to spam around.
<b>Also you can change following things:</b>
- Enable/Disable AntiSpam
- Enable/Disable Admin-AntiSpam
- Enable/Disable Tool-AntiSpam
- Set Tool-AntiSpam only for chosen tools (Controlled by a nice panel)
- Enable/Disable Prop-Block
- Enable/Disable Tool-Block
- Set 'cooldown' till next Prop-Spawn/Tool-Fire

<h3>Simple but functional</h3>
Also we are pleased to keep the code as simple as possible, to prevent confusions or other similar things.
On the other hand we keep adding new functions to give you more freedom to control and more abilties to set things up like you whish to.

<h3>4 Panels for a good overview</h3>
The Panels are <b>AntiSpam, Prop Protection, Buddy and Cleanup</b>.

Every Panel has Labels to split the functions in there specific sections. This helps, to keep a good overview over all controls, which are available to you.

E.g.
AntiSpam ( main switch, blocking and spawn delay )
PropProtection ( main switch, protections, special protection settings and prop cleanup on disconnect )
Cleanup ( cleanup everything, cleaning all disconnected player's props and cleanup player's props )

<h3>Bug fixing</h3>
We try to keep PatchProtect as bugfree as possible.
If someone posts an error on GitHub or on Workshop, we try to fix the problem as soon as possible. But please have in mind, that we are students, so it could happen that the bugfix would take some time.

<h3>The hardly awaited Buddy-System</h3>
Finally we added a nice working Buddy-System. But please have in mind that this function is VERY new, so it could happen that there are some bugs. Please just post them on GitHub or on Workshop. We will fix them as soon as possible. Also it could happen that we change the code because of some performance improvements or just to make the code more simple as it is right now.
But all in all, it should work pretty well. We tested it some times and found no problems. So enjoy the new Buddy-System!

<h3>Modern Design</h3>
Patchprotect is not just a functional addon. No, it also looks very good. We gave PatchProtect a nice modern design, which makes it easy to see, what you can do or not. Also the checkboxes, as well as some of the buttons and panels have their own modern design.
If you don't like something on the design, you can post a comment on GitHub or on Workshop. Maybe you also have some ideas, which can improve the design.
